# Stock Portfolio Price Tracker

### Python-based app that reports the live stock prices of some of my favorite options, as well as some added customization functionalities to help adjust to user preferences.

Welcome to my customizable stock portfolio price tracker!

Within the program, find my recommended stocks within the tech, WWW and energy sectors, all of which I expect to grow within the years 2020-2030, as well as a "Default" list of random stocks (independent of my recommendation) which the user is free to customize as their own personal list.

Menu options within the program include:

1 -  Track all Lists

2 -  Show all Lists

3 -  Add to Default List

4 -  Edit Default List

5 -  Search live price of any stock:

6 -          Quit

Enjoy!
